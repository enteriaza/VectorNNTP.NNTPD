# NNTP command inventory

Tracker for VectorNNTP.NNTPD command implementations under `src/VectorNNTP.NNTPD/Session/Commands/`.
Command-processing infrastructure (dispatch, catalog, execution, response writer, logging) lives under `src/VectorNNTP.NNTPD/Session/CommandProcessor/`.

- `[x]` = real protocol behavior present (not merely a stub class).
- `[ ]` = registered placeholder; returns not-implemented (or equivalent) until the RFC-compliant handler is written.

Do **not** mark `[x]` solely because a `.cs` file exists, or because a LIST keyword is recognized by the parser. Recognition is not implementation.

CHECK (RFC 4644 §2.4) uses HistoryDB `PeekAsync` (`438` local/Redis hit, `238` double miss without recording the identifier, `431` Redis unavailable). Consecutive transit-authorized CHECK commands may overlap Redis lookups in a per-session window of **16** (`CheckPipeline.Depth`; architectural constant, not configurable). Responses are emitted in send order. Every other command is a serial barrier: outstanding CHECK replies are drained first. See `docs/architecture.md` (Redis and HistoryDB).

LIST / LIST ACTIVE / LIST COUNTS / LIST NEWSGROUPS (RFC 3977 §7.6 / RFC 6048 §2.2) and GROUP (RFC 3977 §6.1.1) read one captured in-memory `NewsgroupSnapshot`. The NNTP command path does not query MySQL. LIST ACTIVE, LIST COUNTS, and LIST NEWSGROUPS write precomputed UTF-8 lines; a wildmat filters by group name only and an empty match is still `215`. LIST ACTIVE and LIST COUNTS status is exactly the stored octet `y` / `n` / `m` / `x` / `j` (RFC 3977 §7.6.3 plus RFC 6048 §3.1 single-letter values). The RFC 6048 `=<newsgroup>` status form is not supported; this is not complete RFC 6048 LIST ACTIVE status support. LIST COUNTS lines are `group high low estimated status` with a single ASCII space between fields. The estimate is the same GROUP watermark estimate already stored on the snapshot (`high − low + 1` when `high >= low`, except the empty `0 0` case; `0` when `high < low`). It is not an exact stored-article count. LISTGROUP remains a registered placeholder (`500`) until an article-number source exists; it does not consult the catalogue and does not invent article numbers from `count_low`/`count_high`. LIST OVERVIEW.FMT and LIST HEADERS are static field-list descriptions (RFC 3977 §8.4 / §8.6), not article-data operations. Both write an immortal precomputed `215` multiline response and do not read the catalogue, NntpDb, or articles. OVERVIEW.FMT uses the RFC 3977 §8.4.2 compatibility names `Bytes:` and `Lines:` (not `:bytes` / `:lines`) and does not invent extra fields. LIST HEADERS, LIST HEADERS MSGID, and LIST HEADERS RANGE return the same static field list because HDR forms are not distinguished; metadata items use the RFC HEADERS names `:bytes` and `:lines`. This is not an implementation of OVER, HDR, or article overview storage. LIST MOTD remains recognized without stored information (`503 Data item not stored`). Unknown LIST keywords (ACTIVE.TIMES, DISTRIB.PATS, DISTRIBUTIONS, MODERATORS, SUBSCRIPTIONS, and any unregistered token) remain `501 Unknown command variant`. Extra arguments on MOTD/OVERVIEW.FMT, invalid HEADERS arguments, extra LIST tokens, and invalid wildmats remain `501`. CAPABILITIES advertises `LIST ACTIVE COUNTS HEADERS NEWSGROUPS OVERVIEW.FMT` with READER. OVER and HDR are not advertised.

POST (RFC 3977 §6.3.1) is not pipelined. `440` is returned when the session is not permitted to post and no article is read. After `340`, the article is streamed under command-work accounting (`Nntpd:MaxArticleSize` destuffed). Client headers that are accepted are written through; server-owned headers (`Path: .POSTED`, `Injection-Date`, `Injection-Info` without a plaintext peer IP, and authenticated-encrypted `X-Trace`) are generated at the header/body boundary. `NNTP-Posting-Date` and `NNTP-Posting-Host` are discarded and are not generated. Client `Control` is rejected (`441`) unless the session has `ControlCancelPermitted` (newsmaster AUTHINFO only) and the header is exactly `cancel <message-id>` per RFC 5536 / RFC 5537 §5.3. Ordinary authenticated users cannot inject `Control`. The protected `X-Trace` payload includes peer IP, peer port, injection timestamp, trace id, and the AUTHINFO username captured at POST admission (empty when the session is unauthenticated). The body is copied with stuffing preserved into one owned stuffed buffer (IHAVE/TAKETHIS queue representation) and admitted with `TryAdmit`. History Peek stays after the terminator. `240` is sent only after queue admission; POST does not await spool or worker processing.

RFC 3977 does not expose the article `Newsgroups:` list before `340`, so group-policy failures after the article (or at the header/body boundary during receive) are `441 Posting failed`, not `440`. Every `Newsgroups:` target is parsed by the existing POST header parser, then checked against one captured `NewsgroupCatalogue.Current` snapshot using the same case-insensitive `TryGet` as GROUP/LIST.

| `posting_status` | Local POST |
|------------------|------------|
| `y` | Ordinary local posting (when every other target is also `y`, or `y` plus authorized/forwarded `m`) |
| `n` | Rejected — local posting prohibited |
| `m` | Moderated. No `Approved:` → proto-article is offered to `IModerationSubmissionService` for the leftmost moderated group (RFC 5537 §3.5.1) and is not injected. `Approved:` → ordinary injection only when the authenticated AUTHINFO principal is configured in `Moderation:Moderators` for every moderated target and the header identities match those routes. |
| `x` | Rejected — closed: local posting and peer articles are prohibited |
| `j` | Rejected — peer-only: local posting is not accepted |
| unknown name | Rejected — the group is not in the captured snapshot |

`Approved:` is an assertion (RFC 5536 mailbox-list), not a boolean and not trust by itself. Header-name comparison is case-insensitive. Mailbox identities compare ASCII case-insensitively. Conflicting identities are rejected; identical duplicates collapse. `Approved: 1` / `true` are malformed. `Control:PgpAuthorities` is not a moderator catalogue.

Moderator reinjection is a normal POST: `AUTHINFO USER/PASS`, then `POST` with `Approved: moderator@example.com`. There is no `MODERATE` command. The authenticated session identity plus the configured mapping is the authorization.

Unapproved moderated forwarding happens after Message-ID/Date are present and before Injection-Info/Injection-Date (RFC 5537 §3.5 step 7). The original Message-ID is preserved. This repository has no SMTP or other mail delivery; the production `IModerationSubmissionService` reports unavailable and POST returns `441`. A successful submission (tests / a future delivery backend) returns `240` (RFC 3977: received, possibly following further processing) and does not Peek, `TryAdmit`, or Remember.

Group-policy and unauthorized-approval rejection drain the article. History Peek / `TryAdmit` / Remember happen only after injection authorization succeeds. Malformed or empty `Newsgroups:` remain syntax failures (`441`) and do not consult the snapshot.

## Recognized LIST keywords (information not stored)

These parse as valid LIST keywords and return `503 Data item not stored`. That is the RFC 3977 §7.6.1.2 response for a recognized keyword whose information is not maintained. It is not a `500` unimplemented-command placeholder, and it is not a successful LIST implementation.

LIST MOTD

IHAVE (RFC 3977 §6.3.2) is a serial, non-pipelined transit ingest: HistoryDB peek → non-blocking Transit queue probe → `335`/`435`/`436` → raw article receive (frame `CRLF . CRLF`, own stuffed wire, no destuff) → non-blocking `TryAdmit` → `235`/`436`/`437`. IHAVE never waits for queue memory; temporary inability to accept is `436`. Downstream `IhaveArticleInterpreter` destuffs IHAVE payloads exactly once and builds `Article`. TAKETHIS production receive/framing is unchanged. See `docs/architecture.md` (IHAVE article ingestion).

`SPEEDTEST <identifier>` is a VectorNNTP private diagnostic extension (not an RFC command). `<identifier>` is the configured Transit dictionary key (exact ordinal match, one NNTP token). `PeerName` is the human-readable administrative name and is not a command argument. The command is transit-authorized and measures TX on the **current** NNTP session with a synthetic payload. It does not open outbound Transit sockets, does not use article ingestion, HistoryDB, or Redis, and never reports measurements that were not performed. Outbound initiator support is not implemented (`OUTBOUND=NOT-AVAILABLE`). See `docs/architecture.md`.

Article ingestion (TAKETHIS and IHAVE → byte-budgeted queue → `spool/incoming`) lives under `ArticleIngestion/`.

Registration lives in `Session/CommandProcessor/DefaultNntpCommandCatalog.cs` (descriptors + authorization metadata only).

## NNTPCancelMessage

`src/VectorNNTP.NNTPCancelMessage` is a separate newsmaster client. It is not part of the NNTP server runtime.

```text
NNTPCancelMessage --host nntpd01.usenet.ninja --port 563 --tls \
  --username newsmaster --password 'secret' <message-id>

NNTPCancelMessage --host nntpd01.usenet.ninja --port 563 --tls \
  --username newsmaster --password 'secret' --cancel <message-id>
```

`--cancel` / `-cancel` is the destructive confirmation. Command-line values override `appsettings.json`. `--password` can appear in OS process listings and shell history; prefer environment or secrets.

Flow: connect → AUTHINFO USER/PASS when credentials are supplied (mandatory for `--cancel`) → `HEAD <message-id>` → decrypt original `X-Trace` → if `--cancel`, canonicalize PGPVERIFY signed fields, sign, then POST an RFC 5536/5537 cancel article that copies the original `Newsgroups` and uses `Control: cancel <message-id>` (not the obsolete RFC 1036 `cmsg` Subject convention). `--cancel` cannot skip signing. RFC 1036 is retained under `docs/standards/rfcs/` for historical reference only. RFC 5536 and RFC 5537 govern the CANCEL article. PGPVERIFY is a de-facto interoperability convention (see `docs/standards/pgpverify/`); it is not an RFC-defined standard. The signed header is `X-PGP-Sig` as FORMAT specifies, not PGP/MIME and not `X-PGP-Signature`. Server-owned Path / Injection-Date / Injection-Info / X-Trace remain unsigned and are generated by POST.

**HEAD limitation:** VectorNNTP.NNTPD `HEAD` remains a registered placeholder. There is no article catalogue yet, so this utility targets an upstream/peer NNTP server that implements RFC 3977 `HEAD` (221 headers only / 430). Integration is proven against a loopback scripted NNTP server; do not invent a fake catalogue on VectorNNTP to satisfy the utility.
