/// session and source-IP ownership together, or extends none of them.
/// The background <see cref="SessionStateService"/> is the sole scheduler; this
/// abstraction owns the actual ownership snapshot and Redis operations. When a
/// MySQL-committed byte batch exists for an owned account, renewal and APPLY
/// share one Redis EVAL. A successful renew also returns the cluster session
/// total so local R-account rate caps can be updated without a second scheduler.
